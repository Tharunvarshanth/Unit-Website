  <i>  <b style="font-size:32px">Software Engineering Teaching Unit</b><br><br>
    <label style="font-size:20px"> The Software Engineering Teaching Unit (SETU) was established in September 2017 with the objective of preparing students for successful careers in the field of Software Engineering by providing a thorough understanding of engineering methods and scientific principles. The unit conducts the Bachelor of Science Honours in Software Engineering degree which is the only degree program in software engineering offered in the state university system in Sri Lanka. SETU offers core and optional course modules leveraging aspects of computer science, engineering and management. Through industrial training programs as well as student centered activities, students are facilitated with experiential learning opportunities to successfully meet growing trends and demands in the national economy. Students will be given the opportunity to major in one of the six core domains which are; Net Centric Applications, Mobile Computing Applications, Data Science and Engineering Applications, 
    Health Informatics Applications, Digital Gaming and Animation Applications and Business Engineering Applications.
